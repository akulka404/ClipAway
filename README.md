# ClipAway

### You copy and forget things don't you? ClipAway has you covered!

-[x] Shows you your last 10 clipboard saves
-[x] Creates a log file that saves all your saves with a date and timestamp
-[x] Options to minimize, close and lock the UI on screen if you need it
-[x] Window stays dormant until you hover over it. It'll keep doing its job in the background tho!
-[x] For data other than text, it stores the path to the file you copied, just in case you need to remember what you copied!

Please let me know if this made your life easier! I'd love to collaborate over improving this. I don't know how heavy that log file is going to get but we'll cross that bridge once we get to it.

### To run:

``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
``` pip3 gui.py```

### You're good to go!
